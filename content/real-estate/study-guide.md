This comprehensive guide covers the four most heavily tested topic areas on national real estate license exams: property law, contracts, agency, and finance.

## Part 1: Property Law

### Types of Real Property

**Real property** = land + all permanent attachments (buildings, fixtures, trees, mineral rights).
**Personal property** = everything else (movable items).

**Converting between real and personal property:**
- Personal → Real: **Annexation** (attaching to real property) → creates a fixture
- Real → Personal: **Severance** (removing from real property) → e.g., harvesting timber

**The Fixture Test (Legal vs. Personal Property):**
1. **Method of attachment** — bolted/cemented = fixture
2. **Adaptation** — custom-built for the property = fixture
3. **Intention** — what did the owner intend?

```callout type="tip"
**Exam Tip:** Trade fixtures (business equipment) are an exception — they remain personal property of the tenant even when bolted to the premises, so long as the tenant removes them before the lease ends.
```

### Estates in Real Property

| Estate Type | Duration | Inheritable? | Key Characteristic |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fee Simple Absolute** | Infinite | Yes | Most complete ownership; no conditions |
| **Fee Simple Defeasible** | Until condition violated | Yes (while held) | Reverts on condition breach |
| **Life Estate** | For life of a person | No | Ends at death of measuring life |
| **Leasehold** | Term of lease | No (inheritable lease possible) | Tenant's possessory right |

**Freehold vs. Leasehold:**
- Freehold = ownership interest (fee simple, life estate)
- Leasehold = possessory but not ownership interest

### Bundle of Rights

Property ownership includes a "bundle of rights":
- **Possession** — right to occupy
- **Control** — right to use within law
- **Exclusion** — right to keep others off
- **Enjoyment** — right to use peaceably
- **Disposition** — right to sell, lease, mortgage, gift, or devise

### Encumbrances

Encumbrances affect title but don't prevent ownership:

| Encumbrance | Type | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Easement** | Non-financial | Right to use another's land for specific purpose |
| **Easement appurtenant** | Non-financial | Benefits a dominant estate; runs with land |
| **Easement in gross** | Non-financial | Personal right (utility company); no dominant estate |
| **License** | Non-financial | Revocable permission (parking, viewing event) |
| **Encroachment** | Non-financial | Unauthorized intrusion onto another's land |
| **Lien** | Financial | Security interest; must be paid at closing |
| **Deed restriction (CC&R)** | Non-financial | Private limitation on land use |

**Lien Priority:**
1. Property tax liens (always first priority regardless of recording date)
2. Special assessment liens
3. Mortgage liens (in recording order)
4. Judgment liens
5. Mechanic's liens (priority depends on state law)

### Title & Deeds

**Types of Title Ownership:**
| Ownership Type | Tenants | Right of Survivorship | Can Convey Share? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tenancy in Common | 2+ (unequal OK) | NO | Yes |
| Joint Tenancy | 2+ (equal shares) | YES | Yes (breaks joint tenancy) |
| Tenancy by the Entirety | Married couples only | YES | Only together |
| Community Property | Married in CP states | Varies by state | Varies |

**Types of Deeds:**
- **General Warranty Deed:** Most protection — grantor warrants title against ALL defects
- **Special Warranty Deed:** Grantor only warrants against defects that arose during their ownership
- **Quitclaim Deed:** No warranties — conveys only whatever interest the grantor has (may be nothing)
- **Bargain & Sale Deed:** Implies ownership but no warranties against encumbrances

## Part 2: Contracts

### Essential Elements of a Valid Contract

For a real estate contract to be enforceable, ALL of these must be present:

1. **Offer** — definite and communicated
2. **Acceptance** — mirror image (exact terms)
3. **Consideration** — something of value exchanged
4. **Legal purpose** — not illegal or against public policy
5. **Competent parties** — legal age (18+), mental capacity
6. **In writing** — Statute of Frauds requires real estate contracts to be written

```callout type="important"
**Statute of Frauds:** Real estate purchase contracts, lease agreements longer than 1 year, and listing agreements must be in writing to be enforceable. Verbal real estate purchase contracts are generally unenforceable.
```

### Types of Contracts

| Type | Parties | Characteristics |
|---|---|---|
| **Bilateral** | Both parties | Both promise performance (standard purchase contract) |
| **Unilateral** | One party promises | Other party doesn't promise but acts (option contract) |
| **Express** | Written or verbal | Terms are stated explicitly |
| **Implied** | By conduct/circumstances | No explicit statement |
| **Executed** | Fully performed | Both parties have completed their obligations |
| **Executory** | In process | One or both parties still have obligations |

### Listing Agreements

| Type | Exclusive? | Commission Owed If... | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Exclusive Right to Sell** | Yes | ANY buyer produces sale during listing period | Most common; broker earns commission regardless |
| **Exclusive Agency** | Yes | Broker finds buyer | Seller can sell themselves without paying commission |
| **Open Listing** | No | That broker produces buyer (first to close) | Multiple brokers; seller can also self-sell |
| **Net Listing** | Legal in some states | Price exceeds seller's net | Agent keeps everything above agreed net |

### Purchase Contract Contingencies

Common contingencies that must be satisfied for the sale to close:

1. **Financing contingency:** Buyer must obtain acceptable mortgage
2. **Inspection contingency:** Property must pass inspection (or defects must be resolved)
3. **Appraisal contingency:** Property must appraise at or above purchase price
4. **Home sale contingency:** Buyer's current home must sell first
5. **Title contingency:** Clear title must be delivered

**Remedies for Breach:**
- **Buyer defaults:** Seller may keep earnest money as liquidated damages (if contract allows)
- **Seller defaults:** Buyer may seek specific performance (force the sale) or sue for damages
- **Mutual mistake:** Either party may rescind (cancel) the contract

## Part 3: Agency Law

### Agency Relationships in Real Estate

| Relationship | Who Do They Represent? | Fiduciary Duties To |
|---|---|---|
| **Seller's Agent (Listing Agent)** | Seller | Seller |
| **Buyer's Agent** | Buyer | Buyer |
| **Dual Agent** | Both (with consent) | Both (limited duties) |
| **Designated Agency** | One agent → seller, another → buyer | Respective client |
| **Transaction Broker (non-agent)** | Neither exclusively | Must be fair to both |

### Fiduciary Duties: OLDCAR Mnemonic

| Letter | Duty | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| **O** | Obedience | Follow lawful instructions of the client |
| **L** | Loyalty | Act solely in client's best interest |
| **D** | Disclosure | Disclose all material facts |
| **C** | Confidentiality | Keep client information private |
| **A** | Accounting | Handle client funds properly |
| **R** | Reasonable Care | Use professional skill and diligence |

### Disclosure Requirements

**Material Facts:** A seller's agent must disclose all known material facts that would affect the buyer's decision or the property's value. Examples: roof leaks, past flooding, foundation cracks, neighborhood nuisances.

**Stigmatized Properties:** Disclosure requirements for deaths on property, haunted claims, or neighborhood sex offenders vary significantly by state. Know your state's law.

**What does NOT need to be disclosed (protected classes):** A seller cannot legally disclose (and an agent should not reveal) the race, religion, familial status, or other protected class of neighbors or prior occupants.

## Part 4: Real Estate Finance

### Mortgage Types

| Mortgage Type | Rate | Key Feature |
|---|---|---|
| **Conventional (Fixed)** | Fixed | Same payment throughout term; not government-backed |
| **Adjustable Rate (ARM)** | Variable | Rate adjusts periodically; lower initial rate |
| **FHA** | Fixed or ARM | Government-backed; 3.5% down; flexible credit |
| **VA** | Fixed or ARM | Veterans only; no down payment; no PMI |
| **USDA Rural** | Fixed | Rural areas; no down payment |
| **Jumbo** | Fixed or ARM | Exceeds conforming loan limits |
| **Reverse Mortgage** | Fixed or ARM | 62+; no payments; equity withdrawn |

### Key Mortgage Calculations

- **Loan-to-Value (LTV):** Loan Amount ÷ Appraised Value = LTV%
- **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Front-End:** Monthly PITI ÷ Gross Monthly Income ≤ 28%
- **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Back-End:** Total Monthly Debt Payments ÷ Gross Monthly Income ≤ 36–45%
- **PMI:** Required when LTV > 80% on conventional loans (protects lender)

### Federal Mortgage Laws

| Law | Key Requirement |
|---|---|
| **RESPA** (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act) | Loan Estimate within 3 days; Closing Disclosure 3 days before closing |
| **TILA** (Truth in Lending Act) | APR disclosure; right of rescission on refinances |
| **TRID** (TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure) | Combined LE and CD forms; replaced HUD-1 |
| **ECOA** (Equal Credit Opportunity Act) | Cannot discriminate in lending (protected classes + income) |
| **CRA** (Community Reinvestment Act) | Banks must lend in communities where they take deposits |

### Fair Housing Act

The **Fair Housing Act of 1968** (as amended) prohibits discrimination in residential housing transactions based on:

**Federal Protected Classes (7):**
1. Race
2. Color
3. National Origin
4. Religion
5. Sex/Gender
6. Familial Status (having children under 18)
7. Disability/Handicap

**Prohibited Practices:**
- **Steering:** Directing buyers toward/away from neighborhoods based on protected characteristics
- **Blockbusting:** Inducing owners to sell by warning that protected class members are moving in
- **Redlining:** Refusing to lend/insure in certain areas based on demographics
- **Discrimination in advertising:** Using language that signals preference/limitation

**Exemptions (narrow):** Owner-occupied single-family homes selling without broker AND selling without discriminatory advertising; certain religious organizations; private clubs.

## Flashcard Study Set: Real Estate Key Terms

```flashcards
- front: "What is the difference between a general warranty deed and a quitclaim deed?"
  back: "GENERAL WARRANTY DEED: Grantor guarantees clear title against ALL defects from ANY time, even before they owned it. Highest buyer protection. QUITCLAIM DEED: Conveys ONLY whatever interest the grantor currently has — no warranties whatsoever. Often used between family members or to clear title."

- front: "What are the four unities required for a joint tenancy?"
  back: "TTIP — Time (acquired at same time), Title (same deed), Interest (equal shares), Possession (right to possess whole property). If any unity is broken (e.g., one owner sells their share), the joint tenancy converts to a tenancy in common."

- front: "What is 'time is of the essence' in a real estate contract?"
  back: "A contractual clause making all deadlines strictly binding. If a party fails to perform by the exact deadline (e.g., closing date), it is considered a material breach even if only one day late. Without this clause, courts may allow reasonable delay."

- front: "What does an 'exclusive right to sell' listing agreement mean?"
  back: "The broker earns a commission regardless of WHO finds the buyer — even if the seller finds the buyer themselves. The broker has the exclusive right to represent the property for sale during the listing period. Most common type of listing."

- front: "What are the 7 federal protected classes under the Fair Housing Act?"
  back: "Race, Color, National Origin, Religion, Sex/Gender, Familial Status (children under 18), Disability. Many states add additional protected classes: sexual orientation, marital status, source of income, age. Never steer, blockbust, or redline based on any of these."

- front: "What is 'steering' in real estate?"
  back: "Directing buyers toward or away from specific neighborhoods based on the race, religion, national origin, or other protected characteristics of the residents — whether to keep an area 'homogeneous' or to integrate an area. Steering is a federal Fair Housing violation."

- front: "What is the difference between a VA loan and an FHA loan?"
  back: "VA: Available to eligible veterans and active military ONLY; no down payment required; no PMI; guarantee fee instead of PMI; funded by VA. FHA: Available to all qualified buyers; 3.5% minimum down payment; requires MIP (mortgage insurance premium); insured by FHA. Both are government-backed programs."

- front: "What is the TRID disclosure and when must it be delivered?"
  back: "TRID = TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule. Combines two forms: LOAN ESTIMATE (LE) — must be delivered within 3 business days of receiving loan application. CLOSING DISCLOSURE (CD) — must be delivered at least 3 business days BEFORE closing. Replaced the old GFE and HUD-1."

- front: "What is the legal test for whether an item is a fixture (real property) or personal property?"
  back: "The three-part fixture test: (1) METHOD OF ATTACHMENT — is it permanently attached? (2) ADAPTATION — was it custom-built for this property? (3) INTENTION — what did the owner intend? If intent is unclear, courts look at all three factors together. Fixtures convey with the property unless excluded in writing."

- front: "What is the capitalization rate (cap rate) in real estate investment?"
  back: "Cap Rate = Net Operating Income (NOI) ÷ Property Value. Used to compare investment properties. Higher cap rate = higher return (and typically higher risk). Example: $50,000 NOI ÷ $500,000 value = 10% cap rate. Can also calculate value: Value = NOI ÷ Cap Rate."
```
