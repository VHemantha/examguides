## Real Estate License Exam Overview

The real estate salesperson license exam is required in all 50 states and D.C. before you can practice real estate. The exam tests knowledge of real estate principles, law, and math — with a significant state-specific law component.

## National Exam vs. State Exam

Most states use a two-part exam format:

| Component | Content | Questions (typical) | Passing Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| **National Portion** | Real estate principles, property ownership, contracts, agency, finance, math | 80–100 questions | ~70–75% |
| **State Portion** | State-specific license law, regulations, practices | 30–50 questions | ~70–75% |

The national portion covers concepts that apply across all states. The state portion tests your knowledge of your specific state's laws, license requirements, and regulatory body.

## Frequently Asked Questions

```accordion
## How hard is the real estate license exam?
The national pass rate for first-time real estate license exam takers is approximately 56–60%. Most candidates who fail do so on the state portion due to unfamiliarity with specific state laws. Candidates who complete a full pre-licensing course AND do additional practice exam work pass at much higher rates (70%+).

## How many times can I retake the real estate exam?
Most states allow unlimited retakes, but each retake requires a fee ($50–$150 typically). Some states require waiting periods between attempts (1–30 days). Texas requires the failed section to be retaken within 1 year of the original exam date. After 3 failures in Texas, additional education is required.

## What should I bring to the real estate exam?
Generally required: government-issued photo ID (matching your registration name exactly), your exam confirmation/registration number. NOT permitted: calculators (most states provide a calculator on-screen), notes, code books, or phones. Arrive 30 minutes early — late arrivals are typically turned away.

## What is the difference between a salesperson license and a broker license?
A salesperson (or sales associate) license allows you to practice real estate under the supervision of a licensed broker. A broker license allows independent practice and the ability to manage other agents. Brokers typically need 1–3 years of salesperson experience plus additional education before sitting for the broker exam.

## Do I need a sponsoring broker before I take the exam?
Requirements vary by state. Florida requires no sponsoring broker to sit for the exam (just to activate the license). Texas requires sponsorship before activation. Most states let you pass the exam first, then find a broker sponsor to activate the license. Check your state's specific requirements.
