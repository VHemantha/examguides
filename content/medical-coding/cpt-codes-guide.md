CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) codes are maintained by the American Medical Association (AMA) and describe the medical, surgical, and diagnostic services performed on patients. On the CPC exam, CPT coding accounts for the majority of questions.

## CPT Code Book Structure

CPT codes are 5-digit numeric codes (Category I) organized into six main sections:

| Section | Code Range | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Evaluation & Management | 99202–99499 | Office visits, hospital visits, consultations |
| Anesthesia | 00100–01999 | Anesthesia for surgical procedures |
| Surgery | 10004–69990 | Surgical procedures by body system |
| Radiology | 70010–79999 | Imaging, radiation therapy, nuclear medicine |
| Pathology & Laboratory | 80047–89398 | Lab tests, pathology examinations |
| Medicine | 90281–99199, 99500–99607 | Injections, therapy, psychiatry, ophthalmology |

**Category II Codes:** Supplemental tracking codes (4 digits + F) — not required but used for performance measurement.
**Category III Codes:** Temporary codes for emerging technology (4 digits + T).

## Evaluation & Management (E&M) Coding

E&M coding is the most heavily tested section of the CPC exam and the most common source of claim errors.

### 2021 Office Visit E&M Revisions

In 2021, CMS and the AMA revised E&M guidelines for office visits. The new system uses Medical Decision Making (MDM) OR Total Time as the level-determining factor:

| Code | Level | MDM (New Criteria) | Total Time (New) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 99202 | Level 2 (New Pt) | Straightforward | 15–29 min |
| 99203 | Level 3 (New Pt) | Low complexity | 30–44 min |
| 99204 | Level 4 (New Pt) | Moderate complexity | 45–59 min |
| 99205 | Level 5 (New Pt) | High complexity | 60–74 min |
| 99211 | Level 1 (Est Pt) | No MDM required | Under 10 min |
| 99212 | Level 2 (Est Pt) | Straightforward | 10–19 min |
| 99213 | Level 3 (Est Pt) | Low complexity | 20–29 min |
| 99214 | Level 4 (Est Pt) | Moderate complexity | 30–39 min |
| 99215 | Level 5 (Est Pt) | High complexity | 40–54 min |

### Medical Decision Making (MDM) Components

MDM has three elements. To select an MDM level, at least TWO of the three must meet or exceed that level:

1. **Number and complexity of problems** addressed
2. **Amount and/or complexity of data** reviewed and analyzed
3. **Risk** of complications, morbidity, and/or mortality

| MDM Level | Problems | Data | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Straightforward | 1 minor | Minimal/none | Minimal |
| Low | 2+ minor OR 1 stable chronic | Limited | Low |
| Moderate | 1 uncontrolled chronic OR 1 new with uncertain prognosis | Moderate | Moderate |
| High | 1 severe exacerbation/threat to life | Extensive | High |

### New Patient vs. Established Patient

A "new patient" is one who has NOT received any professional services from the physician or another physician of the same specialty in the same group practice within the past 3 years.

```callout type="important"
**Exam Alert:** If a patient saw Dr. Smith (family medicine) and now sees Dr. Jones (same group, family medicine) for the first time, the patient is ESTABLISHED (same specialty, same group). If Dr. Jones is internal medicine in the same group, the patient may be NEW.
```

## Surgery Section

The Surgery section (10004–69990) is organized by body system:

| Sub-section | Code Range |
|---|---|
| Integumentary | 10004–19499 |
| Musculoskeletal | 20005–29999 |
| Respiratory | 30000–32999 |
| Cardiovascular | 33010–37799 |
| Digestive | 40490–49999 |
| Urinary | 50010–53899 |
| Male Genital | 54000–55899 |
| Female Genital | 56405–58999 |
| Maternity | 59000–59899 |
| Endocrine | 60000–60699 |
| Nervous System | 61000–64999 |
| Eye & Ocular Adnexa | 65091–68899 |
| Auditory | 69000–69979 |

### The Global Surgical Package

All surgical codes include a "global package" — services bundled into the code:

**Included in the global package (do NOT bill separately):**
- Pre-operative evaluation (1 day before)
- Intra-operative services (the procedure itself)
- Complications managed by the surgeon (unless return to OR)
- Post-operative visits during the global period
- Pain management by the surgeon
- Typical supply items

**Global Periods:**
- **Minor procedure:** 0 or 10 days
- **Major procedure:** 90 days

**NOT included in global package:**
- Unrelated E&M visits during global period (append modifier -24)
- Return to OR for complication (modifier -78)
- Additional procedures on same day (modifier -51)
- Significant, separately identifiable E&M same day as procedure (modifier -25)

## Essential CPT Modifiers

Modifiers are 2-digit codes appended to CPT codes to indicate that a service was altered:

| Modifier | Meaning | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| -25 | Significant, separately identifiable E&M same day as procedure | E&M on day of procedure when separately documented |
| -26 | Professional component only | Radiologist reading images taken at another facility |
| -51 | Multiple procedures | Second, third procedures on same day (fee reduction) |
| -52 | Reduced services | Procedure partially performed, not full service |
| -53 | Discontinued procedure | Started but stopped due to patient risk |
| -57 | Decision for surgery | E&M the day before or day of major surgery |
| -59 | Distinct procedural service | Procedures that would normally be bundled but are distinct |
| -62 | Two surgeons | Both surgeons document their distinct work |
| -76 | Repeat procedure by same physician | Same physician repeats procedure same day |
| -77 | Repeat procedure by different physician | Different physician repeats procedure |
| -78 | Return to OR during global period | Same surgeon, related complication |
| -79 | Unrelated procedure during global | During global period, unrelated procedure |
| -80 | Surgical assistant | Surgeon assists at another surgeon's operation |
| TC | Technical component | Facility/equipment component of radiology/lab |
| -LT / -RT | Left / Right | Laterality — required for bilateral structure procedures |

## Integumentary System: High-Yield Coding

### Wound Repair

Three types — complexity determines code selection:
1. **Simple** (12001–12021): Single-layer closure, no complexity
2. **Intermediate** (12031–12057): Two-layer closure OR contaminated wound requiring irrigation
3. **Complex** (13100–13160): Multiple layers, complex anatomic structure

**When multiple wounds are repaired:** Add together all wounds of the SAME complexity and SAME anatomic group, then select ONE code. Do NOT code each wound separately.

### Skin Lesion Removal

- **Benign excision (11400–11471):** Measure the lesion diameter + widest margin on each side
- **Malignant excision (11600–11646):** Same rule but different code range
- **Shaving (11300–11313):** Superficial removal, no full-thickness excision

```callout type="tip"
**Lesion size measurement:** Always use the TOTAL EXCISED DIAMETER including the narrowest margin (not just the lesion). Add the lesion size + margin × 2 = CPT code size.
```

## NCCI Edits and Unbundling

**NCCI (National Correct Coding Initiative)** edits are CMS rules that prevent billing two codes together that shouldn't be billed together.

**Unbundling:** Coding separately what should be one code. Example: Billing a "panel" lab test (e.g., 80053 Comprehensive Metabolic Panel) PLUS all its individual component tests — this is unbundling and is FRAUD.

Types of NCCI edits:
1. **Mutually exclusive edits:** Two procedures that cannot reasonably be performed together
2. **Comprehensive/component edits:** One code is a component of another (always bill the comprehensive code)

Some NCCI edits can be overridden with modifier -59 (or X{EPSU} modifiers) when the procedures were truly distinct.

## Anesthesia Coding

Anesthesia is billed differently from other CPT codes:

**Formula:** (Base Units + Time Units + Qualifying Circumstances) × Conversion Factor = Fee

- **Base units:** Fixed per anesthesia CPT code (reflects complexity)
- **Time units:** Usually 1 unit per 15 minutes
- **Qualifying circumstances:** Add-on codes for extreme age, emergency, hypotension

**Physical Status Modifiers:**
| Modifier | Class | Description |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | Normal healthy patient | No systemic disease |
| P2 | Mild systemic disease | Controlled HTN, mild asthma |
| P3 | Severe systemic disease | Uncontrolled diabetes, moderate COPD |
| P4 | Severe, constant threat to life | Advanced heart failure |
| P5 | Not expected to survive | Moribund patient |
| P6 | Brain-dead for organ donation | |

## Quick Reference: Common CPC Exam Traps

```tabs
## E&M Traps
- **New vs. established:** 3-year rule applies to the SPECIALTY in the same group
- **Time-based coding:** Total time includes ONLY time on the date of the encounter
- **99211:** Does not require physician presence; may be for nurse visit
- **Hospital initial inpatient:** 99221–99223 (even if patient was transferred from your office)
- **Telehealth:** Use same E&M codes with GT modifier or 95 modifier

## Surgery Traps
- **Staged procedure (-58):** Planned second stage during global period
- **Same-day procedures:** -51 modifier on lower-valued procedure (not on add-ons)
- **Bilateral:** Many musculoskeletal codes require -50 modifier for bilateral; some include bilateral
- **Skin lesion:** Always add together same-complexity same-area wounds before coding
- **Global days:** Minor = 0 or 10 days; Major = 90 days

## Radiology Traps
- **Supervision and interpretation:** Technical component (TC) = taking the image; -26 = reading/reporting
- **Complete ultrasound:** Must document ALL required elements or use "limited" code
- **CT with contrast, without contrast, with and without:** Three different codes exist
- **Mammography:** Screening (77067) vs. diagnostic (77065, 77066) — reason for exam matters
