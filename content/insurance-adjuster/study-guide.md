## Property Insurance: Homeowners Policies (HO Forms)

The HO policy series is foundational knowledge for any adjuster. Each form specifies what perils are covered and what property is included.

| Form | Name | Coverage Type | Dwelling | Personal Property |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| HO-1 | Basic Form | Named Perils (11) | Yes | Yes |
| HO-2 | Broad Form | Named Perils (17) | Yes | Yes |
| HO-3 | Special Form | Open Perils (dwelling), Named Perils (contents) | Yes | Yes |
| HO-4 | Renters | Named Perils | No (tenant only) | Yes |
| HO-5 | Comprehensive | Open Perils (both) | Yes | Yes |
| HO-6 | Condo Unit Owners | Named Perils | Interior walls only | Yes |
| HO-7 | Mobile/Manufactured Home | Open Perils | Yes | Yes |
| HO-8 | Older/Modified Coverage | Named Perils (limited) | ACV basis | Yes |

**Key Exam Point:** HO-3 is the most common homeowners policy in the US. It covers the dwelling on an **open perils** basis (all causes except those excluded) but covers contents on a **named perils** basis.

### The 16 Named Perils (HO-2 and HO-4 standard list)
1. Fire or lightning
2. Windstorm or hail
3. Explosion
4. Riot or civil commotion
5. Aircraft
6. Vehicles
7. Smoke
8. Vandalism or malicious mischief
9. Theft
10. Falling objects
11. Weight of ice, snow, or sleet
12. Accidental discharge of water
13. Sudden/accidental tearing apart of heating system
14. Freezing of plumbing
15. Sudden/accidental damage from electrical current
16. Volcanic eruption

## Dwelling Policies (DP Forms)

Dwelling policies cover non-owner-occupied residential structures (rental properties, vacation homes):

- **DP-1 (Basic Form):** Named perils — fire, lightning, internal explosion only
- **DP-2 (Broad Form):** Named perils — expanded list similar to HO-2
- **DP-3 (Special Form):** Open perils on dwelling, named perils on contents

## Personal Auto Policy (PAP) Components

The standard ISO Personal Auto Policy has six parts:

| Part | Coverage | What It Pays |
|---|---|---|
| Part A | Liability | Bodily injury and property damage you cause to others |
| Part B | Medical Payments | Medical expenses for you and passengers (regardless of fault) |
| Part C | Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist | Your injuries when hit by uninsured/underinsured driver |
| Part D | Damage to Your Auto | Collision and comprehensive (other-than-collision) |
| Part E | Duties After Accident | Not a coverage — policyholder obligations |
| Part F | General Provisions | Policy terms, cancellation, territory |

**Collision vs. Comprehensive:**
- **Collision:** Damage from impact with another vehicle or object
- **Comprehensive (Other-Than-Collision):** Theft, fire, flood, hail, vandalism, hitting an animal, falling objects

## Liability Insurance Fundamentals

**Occurrence Policy:** Covers claims arising from incidents that occurred during the policy period, regardless of when the claim is filed.

**Claims-Made Policy:** Covers claims that are both made AND reported during the policy period (or extended reporting period).

**Key Terms:**
- **Bodily Injury (BI):** Physical harm to a person
- **Property Damage (PD):** Damage to tangible property
- **Personal Injury (PI):** Non-physical harm — libel, slander, false arrest, invasion of privacy
- **Advertising Injury:** Harm from advertising activities — copyright infringement, misleading ads

### Umbrella/Excess Liability
An umbrella policy provides additional liability limits above the underlying auto and homeowners policies. Key features:
- Requires minimum underlying limits (typically $300,000 auto/$300,000 home)
- Drops down to cover some claims the underlying policy excludes
- Excess policies only pay after underlying limits are exhausted (no drop-down)

## Workers' Compensation Insurance

Workers' comp provides no-fault benefits to employees injured on the job. Adjusters handling WC claims must know:

**Four Types of WC Benefits:**
1. **Medical Benefits:** All reasonable and necessary medical treatment
2. **Disability Benefits:** Wage replacement — temporary total, temporary partial, permanent total, permanent partial
3. **Vocational Rehabilitation:** Retraining for workers unable to return to prior work
4. **Death Benefits:** Burial expenses and survivor income

**Exclusions (common):**
- Self-inflicted injuries
- Injuries during criminal activity
- Injuries caused by intoxication
- Injuries outside the scope of employment

## The Claims Process

Understanding every step of the claims process is critical for adjusters:

```accordion
## Step 1: First Notice of Loss (FNOL)
The insured or claimant reports the claim to the insurer. Adjusters must acknowledge receipt within state-mandated timeframes (typically 10 days). Key FNOL tasks: record date/time, assign claim number, document initial facts, identify parties and coverage.

## Step 2: Investigation
The adjuster investigates to determine: (1) Did the loss occur? (2) Is the loss covered under the policy? (3) What is the value of the loss? Investigation tools include recorded statements, scene inspection, photo documentation, police/fire reports, medical records, expert consultants (engineers, appraisers).

## Step 3: Coverage Analysis
Review the policy declarations page, insuring agreement, exclusions, conditions, and endorsements. Determine: Is there a valid policy in effect? Does the insured have an insurable interest? Is the peril covered? Do any exclusions apply? Are all policy conditions met?

## Step 4: Damage Assessment & Valuation
Methods of valuing property losses: Actual Cash Value (ACV = replacement cost minus depreciation), Replacement Cost Value (RCV = cost to repair/replace with like kind and quality), Agreed Value, Stated Value, Functional Replacement Cost.

## Step 5: Reserving
Set a reserve — an estimate of the ultimate cost of the claim. Reserves must be reasonable and regularly updated. Under-reserving leads to regulatory problems; over-reserving inflates loss ratios.

## Step 6: Settlement or Denial
Pay the claim, negotiate a settlement, issue a denial with written explanation, or refer to litigation. State laws mandate settlement timeframes. Unfair claims settlement practices (UCSP) laws prohibit: misrepresenting policy provisions, failing to promptly investigate, offering unreasonably low settlements.

## Step 7: Subrogation
If a third party caused the loss, the insurer has the right to recover paid amounts from the responsible party after settling with the insured. Adjusters must preserve subrogation rights throughout the claims process.
```

## Key Legal Doctrines for Adjusters

| Doctrine | Definition | Exam Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| **Subrogation** | Insurer steps into insured's shoes to sue responsible party | High — appears frequently |
| **Indemnity** | Insurance restores insured to pre-loss condition, no profit | High — foundational principle |
| **Insurable Interest** | Insured must stand to suffer financial loss | High — policy validity |
| **Contribution** | Multiple insurers share loss proportionally | Medium — coordination of benefits |
| **Proximate Cause** | Closest cause of the loss (efficient proximate cause) | High — coverage disputes |
| **Comparative Negligence** | Liability split based on each party's fault percentage | Medium — liability claims |
| **Contributory Negligence** | Plaintiff's negligence bars recovery (used in few states) | Low — rare, note which states |
| **Statute of Limitations** | Time limit to file a lawsuit | Medium — missed deadlines |

## Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act

Every adjuster must know the behaviors prohibited by state UCSP statutes (modeled on the NAIC model act):

- Misrepresenting facts or policy provisions
- Failing to acknowledge claims communications promptly
- Failing to adopt reasonable claims investigation standards
- Refusing to pay claims without reasonable investigation
- Failing to affirm or deny coverage within a reasonable time
- Compelling insureds to sue by offering unreasonably low amounts
- Making claims payments without stating the coverage provision relied upon
- Attempting to settle claims for less than a reasonable person would believe they are entitled to

```callout type="important"
**Exam Alert:** Most states require adjusters to acknowledge receipt of a claim within **10 business days** and accept or deny the claim within **15–45 days** of receiving a proof of loss. Memorize your state's specific timeframes.
```

## Flashcard Study Set: Key Terms

```flashcards
- front: "What is subrogation?"
  back: "The legal right of an insurer who has paid a loss to recover that payment from a legally responsible third party. Example: After paying for your car repairs after another driver hit you, your insurer sues that driver for reimbursement."

- front: "What is an occurrence policy vs. a claims-made policy?"
  back: "OCCURRENCE: Covers claims from incidents that happened during the policy period, regardless of when the claim is filed. CLAIMS-MADE: Covers claims that are both filed AND reported during the policy period (or tail period)."

- front: "What does HO-3 cover on an open perils basis?"
  back: "HO-3 covers the DWELLING (structure) on an open perils/all-risk basis — meaning all causes of loss are covered EXCEPT those specifically excluded. The CONTENTS are covered on a named perils basis."

- front: "What are the four types of workers' compensation benefits?"
  back: "1. Medical Benefits (treatment costs) 2. Disability Benefits (wage replacement — temporary/permanent, total/partial) 3. Vocational Rehabilitation (retraining) 4. Death Benefits (burial + survivor income)"

- front: "What is actual cash value (ACV)?"
  back: "ACV = Replacement Cost Value MINUS Depreciation. It represents the fair market value of property at the time of loss. ACV always equals less than or equal to the cost to replace the item new."

- front: "What is the difference between collision and comprehensive coverage?"
  back: "COLLISION: Damage when your vehicle hits or is hit by another vehicle or object. COMPREHENSIVE (Other-than-collision): Damage from theft, fire, flood, hail, vandalism, animals, falling objects, glass breakage."

- front: "What is the proximate cause doctrine?"
  back: "The proximate cause is the primary/dominant cause of a loss. When multiple causes contribute to a loss, adjusters must identify the proximate (closest efficient) cause to determine coverage. If that cause is covered, the loss is generally covered."

- front: "What is the indemnity principle in insurance?"
  back: "Insurance is designed to restore the insured to the same financial position they were in before the loss — no better, no worse. This prevents profiting from insurance and is why ACV (not new replacement cost) is often the standard valuation."

- front: "What is a reservation of rights letter?"
  back: "A formal notice from the insurer to the insured stating that the insurer is investigating the claim but reserves the right to deny coverage based on certain policy provisions or exclusions. Required when coverage is in doubt to avoid waiving defenses."

- front: "Name three prohibited Unfair Claims Settlement Practices."
  back: "1. Misrepresenting policy provisions or facts to deny/reduce claims 2. Failing to promptly acknowledge and investigate claims 3. Compelling insureds to litigate by offering unreasonably low settlements. (Also: failing to affirm/deny coverage in reasonable time, making material omissions)"
