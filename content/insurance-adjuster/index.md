## What Is an Insurance Adjuster?

An insurance adjuster (also called a claims adjuster or claims examiner) investigates insurance claims to determine the extent of the insurer's liability. Adjusters work for insurance companies (staff adjusters), as independent contractors (independent adjusters), or on behalf of policyholders (public adjusters).

Every state requires adjusters to be licensed, and most states require passing a written examination before licensure is granted.

## Types of Insurance Adjusters

| Adjuster Type | Who They Work For | Licensing Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Staff Adjuster | Insurance company directly | Full license required |
| Independent Adjuster | Third-party firms, hired by insurers | License in each state of operation |
| Public Adjuster | Policyholder/insured | Most stringent licensing; fiduciary duty to insured |
| Catastrophe (CAT) Adjuster | Hired after major disasters | May need non-resident licenses quickly |

## State-Specific Requirements

### Texas (All-Lines Adjuster)
Texas offers the comprehensive **All-Lines Adjuster** license, which covers property, casualty, workers' compensation, and health claims. The exam is administered by Pearson VUE and consists of multiple sections. Texas uses a "license-first, exam-after" approach for workers' compensation. See our [Texas All-Lines Study Guide](/insurance-adjuster/study-guide/) for full details.

### Florida (6-20 All-Lines)
Florida's **6-20 All-Lines** license is one of the most sought-after for independent adjusters because it allows work across all lines. The exam includes both personal and commercial lines. Florida has strict continuing education requirements (24 hours per 2-year period).

### California
California splits adjusters into Fire & Casualty and Disability categories. The state is known for its rigorous consumer protection laws and the California Department of Insurance's strict oversight.

## Frequently Asked Questions

```accordion
## How long is the insurance adjuster license exam?
Most state adjuster license exams run 1.5 to 3 hours, with 50 to 160 questions depending on the license type and state. Texas's All-Lines exam is one of the longer ones at up to 150 questions. Time management is important—most candidates have about 1–1.5 minutes per question.

## Do I need prior insurance experience to take the adjuster exam?
Most states do not require prior work experience to sit for the adjuster licensing exam. You need to meet age requirements (usually 18+), complete any required pre-licensing education hours, pass the exam, and submit a license application. Some states require a background check.

## Can I hold an adjuster license in multiple states?
Yes. Most states offer non-resident adjuster licenses that allow you to handle claims in that state without establishing residency. Independent and catastrophe adjusters often hold licenses in 5–20+ states. Each state has its own application process and fees.

## What is the difference between a staff adjuster and an independent adjuster?
A staff adjuster is a full-time employee of an insurance company. An independent adjuster is a self-employed contractor or works for an independent adjusting firm and handles claims for multiple insurers. Independent adjusters often work catastrophe claims during major weather events and can earn significantly more during busy periods.

## How much do insurance adjusters earn?
According to BLS data, the median annual salary for claims adjusters, examiners, and investigators was approximately $72,000 in 2024. Independent adjusters working catastrophe claims can earn $80,000–$150,000+ during active hurricane or hail seasons. Public adjusters typically earn a percentage (10–15%) of the settled claim.
