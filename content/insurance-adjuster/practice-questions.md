## Section 1: Property Coverage (Questions 1–10)

```accordion
## 1. A homeowner's dwelling is destroyed by fire. The home is insured under an HO-3 policy with a $400,000 dwelling limit and $300,000 in replacement cost coverage. The replacement cost is $380,000. How much will the insurer pay (before deductible)?
**Answer: $380,000**

Explanation: Under an HO-3 with replacement cost coverage, the insurer pays the actual cost to repair or replace the damaged property with like kind and quality, up to the policy limit. The replacement cost of $380,000 is less than the $400,000 limit, so the full $380,000 is payable. The deductible would then reduce this amount.

## 2. Which homeowners policy form covers both the dwelling AND personal property on an open perils basis?
**Answer: HO-5 (Comprehensive Form)**

Explanation: The HO-5 is the broadest standard homeowners form, providing open perils (all-risk) coverage on BOTH the dwelling structure AND personal property. The HO-3 only provides open perils on the dwelling; the HO-2 uses named perils for both. The HO-5 is ideal for high-value homes with expensive contents.

## 3. A tenant renting an apartment has her laptop stolen from her car. Which policy would cover this loss?
**Answer: HO-4 (Renters Policy) — Personal Property coverage**

Explanation: The HO-4 (renters form) covers the insured's personal property against named perils, including theft, even when the property is away from the residence. The tenant's landlord's property policy would not cover the tenant's belongings. Note: coverage for off-premises theft may be subject to a sublimit (often 10% of the personal property limit).

## 4. Under a standard homeowners policy, which of the following losses would be EXCLUDED?
A) Fire damage from a wildfire
B) Theft of jewelry
C) Flood damage from a river overflowing
D) Wind damage from a hurricane

**Answer: C) Flood damage from a river overflowing**

Explanation: Flood is a standard exclusion in all homeowners policies. "Flood" under homeowners exclusions means surface water, overflow of water bodies, and storm surge. Separate flood coverage must be obtained through the NFIP or private flood insurers. Fire, theft (subject to limits), and wind are typically covered named perils or not excluded under open perils.

## 5. Under an HO-3 policy, a tree falls on an insured's car during a windstorm. The car is damaged. Which coverage would apply?
**Answer: Neither — Auto damage is excluded from HO policies**

Explanation: Homeowners policies exclude coverage for motor vehicles. The car damage must be handled under the owner's auto policy (comprehensive/other-than-collision coverage would apply for a falling tree). However, if the same falling tree damaged the HOME, the HO-3 would cover the dwelling damage (windstorm is an excluded peril on some forms but generally covered — check your state).

## 6. An insured discovers their antique vase was broken during moving. The HO-3 policy has a $1,500 personal property sublimit for breakage. The vase's ACV is $3,200. How much does the insurer pay?
**Answer: $1,500 (less applicable deductible)**

Explanation: When a policy establishes a sublimit (special limit of liability) for a specific category of property, that sublimit caps the recovery regardless of the actual loss value. Antiques, fine arts, and fragile items often have sublimits in standard HO policies. The insured should have scheduled this item on a personal articles floater for full value coverage.

## 7. The "other structures" coverage in a standard HO policy typically provides what percentage of the dwelling limit?
**Answer: 10% of Coverage A (dwelling)**

Explanation: Standard ISO homeowners forms provide "Coverage B — Other Structures" at 10% of the Coverage A dwelling limit. This covers detached garages, fences, guest houses, and similar structures not attached to the main dwelling. Example: $400,000 dwelling limit = $40,000 in other structures coverage.

## 8. Which of the following is NOT covered under Coverage C (Personal Property) of a standard HO policy?
A) Furniture
B) Clothing
C) A car parked in the garage
D) Electronics

**Answer: C) A car parked in the garage**

Explanation: Motor vehicles are explicitly excluded from personal property coverage (Coverage C) in homeowners policies. This exclusion prevents double coverage with auto policies and is one of the most commonly tested exclusions. Aircraft, hovercraft, and most watercraft over a certain size are also excluded from Coverage C.

## 9. An insured's home sustains smoke damage from a neighbor's fire. The smoke entered through open windows. Is this covered under HO-3?
**Answer: Yes — Smoke is a named peril and not excluded under open perils**

Explanation: Smoke is one of the 16 standard named perils in broad form policies (HO-2). Under HO-3's open perils dwelling coverage, smoke damage is covered because it is not specifically excluded. The fact that the fire originated with a neighbor doesn't matter — the peril (smoke) is what determines coverage, not the source. Subrogation rights may allow the insurer to recover from the negligent neighbor.

## 10. What is the purpose of a "coinsurance clause" in a commercial property policy?
**Answer: To require the insured to maintain coverage equal to a specified percentage (typically 80%) of the property's full replacement cost value or face a penalty at claim time**

Explanation: Coinsurance (or co-insurance) provisions encourage adequate insurance. If an insured carries less than the required percentage (e.g., 80% of replacement cost), they become a "co-insurer" for the deficiency. The penalty formula is: (Amount of Insurance Carried ÷ Amount of Insurance Required) × Loss Amount = Claim Payment. Note: Standard HO policies do NOT have coinsurance clauses — this applies to commercial property.
```

## Section 2: Liability & Auto (Questions 11–20)

```accordion
## 11. An insured rear-ends another driver, injuring two occupants. The insured's auto policy has 100/300/100 limits. The total judgment is $250,000 ($150,000 per person). How much will the policy pay for each person?
**Answer: $100,000 per person (total of $200,000 for both)**

Explanation: The "100/300/100" split limits mean: $100,000 per person bodily injury / $300,000 per occurrence / $100,000 property damage. Even though one judgment is $150,000, the per-person limit caps payment at $100,000 per claimant. The aggregate occurrence limit of $300,000 is not triggered here since 2 × $100,000 = $200,000 < $300,000. The insured would be personally responsible for the $50,000 per person shortfall.

## 12. What is the primary difference between an occurrence policy and a claims-made policy?
**Answer: An occurrence policy covers incidents that HAPPEN during the policy period (whenever the claim is filed). A claims-made policy requires the claim to be BOTH made and reported during the policy period.**

Explanation: This distinction is critical for liability claims with long latency periods. Example: An occurrence policy from 2015 would still cover a construction defect discovered in 2026 if the defect occurred in 2015. A claims-made policy from 2015 that was not renewed would NOT cover a claim filed in 2026, even if the injury occurred during the policy period.

## 13. A contractor's general liability policy has a $1,000,000 per occurrence / $2,000,000 aggregate limit. During the policy year, three covered claims are paid: $700,000, $600,000, and $400,000. How much does the policy pay on the third claim?
**Answer: $700,000 (aggregate limit reached)**

Explanation: After the first two claims ($700,000 + $600,000 = $1,300,000), only $700,000 remains in the aggregate. The third claim of $400,000 would normally be paid in full, but wait — $1,300,000 + $400,000 = $1,700,000, which is under the $2,000,000 aggregate. The full $400,000 would be paid. The total paid would be $1,700,000 with $300,000 remaining in aggregate. (Tricky math — always subtract as you go.)

## 14. Under a personal auto policy, which coverage pays for damage to the INSURED'S vehicle when a deer runs into the road and the driver swerves and hits a guardrail?
**Answer: Collision**

Explanation: This is a frequently tested scenario. The actual collision was with the guardrail (an object), making it a collision loss — not comprehensive. Comprehensive covers hitting an animal DIRECTLY (swerving to avoid is collision). Some insurers may argue either way, but the standard ISO PAP treats running off-road after swerving as a collision loss.

## 15. Which liability coverage DOES NOT require fault to be established before payment?
A) Bodily Injury Liability
B) Medical Payments (MedPay)
C) Property Damage Liability
D) Uninsured Motorist Bodily Injury

**Answer: B) Medical Payments (MedPay)**

Explanation: Medical Payments coverage is a no-fault coverage — it pays for reasonable medical expenses for the insured and passengers regardless of who caused the accident. In contrast, BI and PD liability coverages require the insured to be legally liable (at fault). UM/UIM requires that the other driver be uninsured/underinsured and at fault.

## 16. What is "stacking" of auto insurance limits?
**Answer: Combining (stacking) the UM/UIM limits from multiple auto policies to create a higher total limit available for one claim**

Explanation: Example: An insured has two cars, each with $50,000 UM coverage. If stacking is permitted, the combined UM limit would be $100,000. Many states have "anti-stacking" provisions that prohibit this practice. Stacking can be "horizontal" (across multiple policies) or "vertical" (multiple coverages on one policy). Exam tip: Know whether your state allows stacking.

## 17. An uninsured driver runs a red light and injures a pedestrian. The pedestrian sues the driver. The driver has no assets and no insurance. What recourse does the pedestrian have?
**Answer: The pedestrian can file an UM claim under THEIR OWN auto policy if they have one (pedestrians are covered as insureds), or seek compensation from the state's uninsured motorist fund (where available).**

Explanation: UM coverage follows the insured — a pedestrian struck by an uninsured vehicle can file a UM claim under their personal auto policy even though they weren't in their car. This is a commonly tested nuance. Some states have MVAIC (Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation) programs for uninsured victims who have no UM coverage.

## 18. A general liability policy excludes "expected or intended injury." A business owner intentionally shoves a customer, causing injury. Would the GL policy defend/pay?
**Answer: No — The intentional act exclusion applies**

Explanation: Standard CGL policies exclude bodily injury or property damage expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured. An intentional shove is clearly expected to cause harm. The insurer has no duty to defend or indemnify. Note: Criminal acts exclusions work separately but overlap here. The individual may still be personally liable (just not insured for it).

## 19. Under the personal auto policy, who qualifies as an "insured" for liability purposes?
**Answer: (1) Named insured and family members residing in the household; (2) any person using a covered auto with permission; (3) any person or organization liable for use of a covered auto**

Explanation: The broad definition of "insured" for liability is one of the PAP's most important features. A neighbor borrowing your car with permission is an insured for that trip. A company for which you're running an errand may qualify under the "organization" clause. Non-permissive users are NOT insureds.

## 20. What is the "business use" exclusion in a personal auto policy?
**Answer: It excludes coverage for vehicles used as taxis, for-hire transportation (rideshare), or regularly for commercial purposes — these require commercial auto or TNP (transportation network company) endorsements**

Explanation: Standard personal auto policies are designed for personal use. Using a vehicle for ridesharing (Uber/Lyft), delivery (commercial), or other business transportation typically voids or limits coverage unless a commercial auto policy or specific endorsement is in place. This is a significant coverage gap many policyholders don't know about.

## Section 3: Claims Process & Ethics (Questions 21–30)

```accordion
## 21. An adjuster tells a claimant that the policy doesn't cover the loss when in fact it does, in order to save the company money. This is an example of:
**Answer: An Unfair Claims Settlement Practice (specifically, misrepresenting policy provisions)**

Explanation: Misrepresenting facts or policy provisions to deny a claim or reduce payment is explicitly prohibited under every state's Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act (modeled on the NAIC model act). This is one of the most egregious violations and can result in license revocation, fines, and bad faith litigation against the insurer.

## 22. How many days do most states require an insurer to acknowledge receipt of a claim?
**Answer: 10 business days (in most states)**

Explanation: Most states, following NAIC model act guidance, require acknowledgment within 10 business days of receiving notice of a claim. The full investigation and coverage decision timeline varies — typically 15–45 days from receipt of the proof of loss. Memorize your state's specific deadlines as they are frequently tested.

## 23. An adjuster investigates a fire claim and suspects arson. What should the adjuster do?
**Answer: Thoroughly document all evidence, refer to the SIU (Special Investigations Unit), and if denying the claim, provide a written denial with the specific policy provisions relied upon. Report to state authorities if required.**

Explanation: Suspected fraud/arson must be handled carefully. The adjuster should NOT accuse the insured without substantial evidence. The SIU investigates and works with law enforcement. Most states require insurers to report suspected arson to the state fire marshal. The adjuster must follow proper procedures to preserve both the right to deny the claim and the insurer's legal standing.

## 24. What is a "reservation of rights" letter and when must an adjuster send one?
**Answer: A written notice informing the insured that the insurer is investigating the claim under a full reservation of its rights to deny coverage based on specific policy provisions. Must be sent whenever coverage is questionable before completing investigation.**

Explanation: Without a ROR letter, an insurer may inadvertently waive a coverage defense by investigating or engaging with a claim. The ROR letter preserves the insurer's right to later deny coverage even while cooperating with the insured. It must be sent promptly — before the dispute crystallizes. Failure to send a timely ROR letter has resulted in courts finding estoppel against insurers.

## 25. An insured's business is burglarized, and merchandise worth $50,000 is stolen. The business has a commercial property policy with a $1,000 deductible and a "coinsurance clause" at 80%. The building's replacement cost value is $500,000 but the insured only carries $300,000 in coverage. How is the loss calculated?
**Answer: $29,250 paid by insurer (after penalty and deductible)**

Calculation:
- Required insurance = $500,000 × 80% = $400,000
- Carried insurance = $300,000
- Coinsurance ratio = $300,000 / $400,000 = 75%
- Covered loss = $50,000 × 75% = $37,500
- Less deductible = $37,500 - $1,000 = $36,500

Wait — the property stolen is contents, not the building. If the contents are under a separate coverage form with its own limits, apply the same formula to the contents. This question as stated would require the contents limit information. The key learning: coinsurance penalties can significantly reduce claim payments, and adjusters must check compliance at every claim.

## 26. Which of the following best describes "bad faith" in insurance claims handling?
**Answer: A breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing — when an insurer unreasonably denies, delays, or underpays a valid claim without proper cause**

Explanation: Every insurance contract contains an implied covenant of good faith. "Bad faith" occurs when an insurer acts unreasonably in claims handling. First-party bad faith: insurer mistreats its own insured. Third-party bad faith: insurer fails to settle a liability claim within policy limits, exposing insured to excess judgment. Remedies: compensatory damages, consequential damages, and in some states, punitive damages.

## 27. What is the "examination under oath" (EUO) and when can an insurer require it?
**Answer: A formal sworn statement taken from the insured regarding a claim. Most policies give the insurer the right to require an EUO as a condition of coverage. Failure to comply can be grounds for claim denial.**

Explanation: Unlike a recorded statement (informal), an EUO is conducted under oath with a court reporter and often attorneys present. It is a policy condition, and cooperation is typically required. Adjusters use EUOs in suspected fraud cases, complex claims, or where the insured's cooperation is needed. The insured has the right to have their attorney present.

## 28. A public adjuster signs a contract with a homeowner after a major loss. The contract gives the PA 15% of any settlement. The homeowner later wants to cancel. What are the adjuster's obligations?
**Answer: State laws vary, but most states provide a cooling-off period (typically 3–5 business days) during which the homeowner may cancel without penalty. The PA must comply with all state licensing laws governing contracts and fees.**

Explanation: Public adjusters are regulated differently from staff or independent adjusters. Many states cap PA fees (e.g., 10–20% of settlement), require written contracts, and mandate cooling-off periods. Predatory PA practices after disasters are a significant regulatory concern. Know your state's PA contract requirements.

## 29. After settling a property damage claim with an insured, the adjuster learns that the loss was caused by a negligent contractor. What right does the insurer have?
**Answer: Subrogation — the insurer may proceed against the negligent contractor to recover the amount paid to the insured**

Explanation: Subrogation allows the insurer to "step into the shoes" of the insured after paying a loss. The insurer must NOT do anything to prejudice subrogation rights before the claim is paid. After payment, the insurer can sue the responsible third party. Key: The insurer can only recover what it actually paid — it cannot recover more than the insured's total loss.

## 30. An adjuster with a personal financial interest in a contractor's business recommends that contractor for all repair work on claims they handle. This is an example of:
**Answer: A conflict of interest — a potential violation of the adjuster's fiduciary duties and state insurance laws**

Explanation: Adjusters owe a duty of good faith to both the insurer and the insured. Directing claim repairs to a business in which the adjuster has a personal financial interest creates a conflict of interest, may violate anti-kickback laws, and can result in license discipline. Most states require adjusters to disclose any financial relationships with vendors. This conduct may also constitute fraud.
