Understanding refrigerant classifications, properties, and regulations is core knowledge for the EPA 608 Core and Type I/II/III sections.

## Refrigerant Classification System

Refrigerants are classified by their chemical composition and environmental properties:

| Class | Full Name | Ozone Depletion | Global Warming | Current Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CFCs** | Chlorofluorocarbons | Very High (ODP 0.6–1.0) | Very High (GWP 4,600–10,900) | Banned; no new production |
| **HCFCs** | Hydrochlorofluorocarbons | Low-Moderate (ODP 0.02–0.11) | Moderate (GWP 77–2,310) | Phased out; R-22 banned since 2020 |
| **HFCs** | Hydrofluorocarbons | None (ODP 0) | High (GWP 675–11,700) | Phase-down under AIM Act |
| **HFOs** | Hydrofluoroolefins | None (ODP 0) | Very Low (GWP <1–4) | Current direction |
| **NH3** | Ammonia (R-717) | None | None (GWP 0) | Industrial use; toxic |
| **CO2** | Carbon Dioxide (R-744) | None | Very Low (GWP 1) | Growing use in commercial |
| **Hydrocarbons** | Propane (R-290), Isobutane (R-600a) | None | Very Low | Flammable; growing residential use |

## Common Refrigerants Reference Table

| Refrigerant | Type | Replaced By | ODP | GWP | Applications |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R-11 | CFC | R-123 | 1.0 | 4,600 | Centrifugal chillers (obsolete) |
| R-12 | CFC | R-134a | 1.0 | 10,900 | Old auto AC, refrigerators (obsolete) |
| R-22 | HCFC | R-410A, R-32 | 0.05 | 1,810 | Old residential AC (banned new use 2020) |
| R-134a | HFC | R-1234yf | 0 | 1,430 | Auto AC, small refrigeration |

| R-410A | HFC | R-32, R-454B | 0 | 2,088 | Residential AC (dominant until ~2025) |
| R-32 | HFC | — | 0 | 675 | Newer residential AC; lower GWP |
| R-454B (Puron Advance) | HFO blend | — | 0 | 466 | New residential equipment |
| R-1234yf | HFO | — | 0 | 4 | Modern auto AC |
| R-717 (Ammonia) | Natural | — | 0 | 0 | Large industrial refrigeration |
| R-744 (CO2) | Natural | — | 0 | 1 | Commercial supermarket |

```callout type="important"
**Exam Alert — R-410A Phase-Down:** R-410A is being phased down under the AIM Act. New residential air conditioning equipment manufactured after January 1, 2025 must use refrigerants with GWP ≤ 750. R-32 (GWP 675) and R-454B (GWP 466) are the primary replacements. You will likely see exam questions about this transition.

## Understanding ODP and GWP

**Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP):**
- Measures a refrigerant's ability to destroy stratospheric ozone relative to R-11 (ODP = 1.0)
- Higher ODP = more ozone-destructive
- Only chlorine and bromine atoms destroy ozone
- HFCs and HFOs: ODP = 0 (no chlorine or bromine)

**Global Warming Potential (GWP):**
- Measures a refrigerant's heat-trapping capacity relative to CO2 (GWP = 1) over 100 years
- Higher GWP = worse for climate
- R-404A (GWP 3,922) is ~4,000 times worse than CO2 per pound released
- Natural refrigerants (NH3, CO2, hydrocarbons) have very low GWPs

## ASHRAE Safety Classifications

ASHRAE Standard 34 classifies refrigerants by toxicity and flammability:

**Toxicity Classes:**
- **Class A:** Lower toxicity (no known toxic concentration at or below 400 ppm)
- **Class B:** Higher toxicity (evidence of toxicity below 400 ppm) — e.g., R-717 (Ammonia)

**Flammability Classes:**
- **Class 1:** No flame propagation (non-flammable) — e.g., R-22, R-410A
- **Class 2L:** Mildly flammable — e.g., R-32, R-454B
- **Class 2:** Flammable — e.g., R-1234ze
- **Class 3:** Highly flammable — e.g., R-290 (propane), R-600a (isobutane)

**Complete Classification Example:**
- R-22: A1 (Lower toxicity, non-flammable)
- R-410A: A1 (Lower toxicity, non-flammable)
- R-32: A2L (Lower toxicity, mildly flammable)
- Ammonia: B2L (Higher toxicity, mildly flammable)

## The Four Rs of Refrigerant Management

```accordion
## Recovery
Removing refrigerant from a system and storing it in an approved cylinder — without testing, cleaning, or reprocessing. Required before opening any sealed system for service. Recovery equipment must be EPA-certified (ARI 740 standard). Recovery levels depend on system size and refrigerant type: for systems with ≥ 200 lbs of HCFC/HFC and compressor running, recover to 0 psig or below.

## Recycling
Cleaning recovered refrigerant using oil separation and moisture removal, then returning it to the same or similar equipment owned by the same customer. Recycled refrigerant is NOT sold — it's reused on-site. No EPA certification of the recycled refrigerant is required. Equipment used must meet ARI 740 standards.

## Reclaiming
Processing refrigerant to ARI 700 purity standards (same as virgin refrigerant) at an EPA-certified reclamation facility. Reclaimed refrigerant can be legally sold. The technician sends the refrigerant to a reclaimer; the reclaimer tests and certifies it. Only reclaimed or new refrigerant may be sold for use.

## Retrofit / Replacement
When a system's original refrigerant is no longer available or being phased out, a "drop-in" or "retrofit" refrigerant may be used. Always check the equipment manufacturer's guidance. Never mix refrigerant types — contaminated or mixed refrigerant must be treated as hazardous waste. Use dedicated recovery cylinders by refrigerant type.
```

## EPA Recovery Requirements

Different systems have different minimum recovery levels before opening:

### For Systems Using CFC/HCFC/HFC Refrigerants:

| System Type | Compressor Status | Recovery Level |
|---|---|---|
| Small appliance (< 5 lbs) | N/A | 90% of refrigerant charge |
| Small appliance | Compressor working | Recover to 4" Hg vacuum |
| Small appliance | Compressor NOT working | 80% recovery or 4" Hg |
| High-pressure (HCFC/HFC, < 200 lbs) | Running | Recover to 0 psig |
| High-pressure (HCFC/HFC, ≥ 200 lbs) | Running | Recover to 0 psig or below |
| Very high pressure (R-410A) | Any | Recover to 0 psig |
| Low-pressure (HCFC-123) | Running | Recover to 25 mm Hg absolute |

```callout type="tip"
**Memory Tip:** "0 psig" is a key target for most high-pressure systems. For low-pressure systems (centrifugal chillers), the target is much lower in absolute pressure terms because these systems operate at sub-atmospheric pressures.
```

## Safe Handling Procedures

**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for Refrigerant Work:**
- Safety glasses or chemical splash goggles (liquid refrigerant causes frostbite and eye damage)
- Chemical-resistant gloves (for liquid R-22, R-410A exposure)
- Long sleeves (prevent skin frostbite from liquid refrigerant)
- Work in ventilated areas — refrigerant vapor is heavier than air and can displace oxygen

**Cylinder Safety:**
- NEVER overfill cylinders — maximum fill is 80% by volume or per DOT markings
- NEVER heat cylinders with an open flame to increase pressure
- Use approved recovery cylinders (yellow/gray for mixed; color-coded by refrigerant)
- Store cylinders upright, secured against falling

**Leak Detection Methods:**
1. Electronic leak detector (most accurate; required for specific applications)
2. Ultrasonic detector (good for large leaks; works on all refrigerants)
3. Fluorescent dye + UV light (confirms leak location)
4. Nitrogen pressure test (before charging; no refrigerant release)
5. Soap bubbles (basic; effective for accessible joints)

## Refrigerant Flashcard Study Set

```flashcards
- front: "What class of refrigerant is R-22 and why was it phased out?"
  back: "R-22 is an HCFC (Hydrochlorofluorocarbon). It was phased out because it has an ODP (Ozone Depletion Potential) of 0.05 — it depletes the stratospheric ozone layer, which protects Earth from UV radiation. R-22 production and import were banned in the US starting January 1, 2020."

- front: "What does ODP stand for and what is its reference point?"
  back: "ODP = Ozone Depletion Potential. It measures a refrigerant's ability to destroy ozone relative to R-11 (CFC-11), which has an ODP of 1.0. A refrigerant with ODP of 0.05 is 5% as destructive to ozone as R-11. HFCs and HFOs have ODP of 0."

- front: "What are the ASHRAE safety classifications for R-410A?"
  back: "R-410A is classified as A1 — A = lower toxicity (safe below 400 ppm), 1 = non-flammable (no flame propagation). This makes R-410A safe for residential use. Compare to R-32 which is A2L (slightly flammable)."

- front: "What is the minimum vacuum level required before opening a high-pressure (R-410A) system for service?"
  back: "For high-pressure systems (R-410A, R-134a, etc.), refrigerant must be recovered to 0 psig (atmospheric pressure) before opening the system. For systems ≥200 lbs charge: same requirement. For low-pressure systems (R-123 centrifugal): 25 mm Hg absolute."

- front: "What is the difference between recovery, recycling, and reclaiming?"
  back: "RECOVERY: Remove refrigerant from system into approved tank (no processing). RECYCLING: Clean refrigerant on-site with oil separation/moisture removal for reuse on same system. RECLAIMING: Process refrigerant to ARI 700 purity at an EPA-certified facility — only reclaimed or new refrigerant can be sold for use by others."

- front: "What is the maximum fill level for a recovery cylinder?"
  back: "80% by volume (to allow for liquid expansion). NEVER fill beyond 80% — overfilled cylinders can rupture from temperature/pressure increase. Always check DOT markings on the cylinder. The old rule was '80% liquid full' at 70°F."

- front: "What refrigerant is R-410A being replaced by for new residential AC equipment after 2025?"
  back: "R-410A (GWP 2,088) is being replaced primarily by R-32 (GWP 675) and R-454B/Puron Advance (GWP 466) for new residential split-system air conditioners, under EPA's AIM Act rules requiring GWP ≤750 for new equipment starting Jan 1, 2025."

- front: "What is the AIM Act and when was it passed?"
  back: "The AIM Act (American Innovation and Manufacturing Act) was passed in December 2020. It authorizes the EPA to phase down HFC refrigerants (which have high global warming potential) by 85% over 15 years (2024-2036) through an allowance program. It also gives EPA authority to regulate HFC substitutes and require safe disposal."
